A simple slider that changes the photo every 20 seconds. Slider can be dynamically changed by the user to any slide by clicking on the button. You can add many photos, buttons to change will be created automatically.
You can also add fields such as title or description to the [sliderList](https://github.com/TEHAQUE/ReactJS-Components/blob/c7c571d8856b02401260069b4a693458ec47930e/slider%20with%20timer/slider.jsx#L5) table and place them somewhere on the page, similarly to [photos in a slider](https://github.com/TEHAQUE/ReactJS-Components/blob/c7c571d8856b02401260069b4a693458ec47930e/slider%20with%20timer/slider.jsx#L53).

## Additional instructions

* It is required to style the elements, because the base style I created may not work in some projects. it all depends on where you will be using it and what your project requires.
* If you change [slide display time](https://github.com/TEHAQUE/ReactJS-Components/blob/c7c571d8856b02401260069b4a693458ec47930e/slider%20with%20timer/slider.jsx#L37), don't forget to change the ***aniamtion-duration*** value in the [animate](https://github.com/TEHAQUE/ReactJS-Components/blob/c7c571d8856b02401260069b4a693458ec47930e/slider%20with%20timer/styl.css#L40) class to the time you want the slide to last.
